    <img src="beef.webp" alt="recepe_pic">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated
        corned beef brisket:

        Brush the whole brisket with browning sauce, then brown it on both sides in a hot skillet with vegetable oil.
        Place it on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter the onions and garlic slices over the brisket. Add water to
        the pan, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and roast in a preheated oven until the meat is tender. </p>
    <p>Corned beef is a beef brisket (a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest) that has been cured in a salt
        solution. "Corning" results in intensely flavorful, super tender meat. In this recipe, the corned beef brisket
        is seared in a hot skillet and then braised all day with garlic and onions for a melt-in-your-mouth texture and
        perfect flavor. </p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen Bouquet®), or as desired </li>

            5 to 8 minutes per side. </li>
